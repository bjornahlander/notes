## Agile Methods
Descriptions of different agile methods/methodologies.
 * Lean software and Kanban
 * Extreme programming (XP)
 * Scrum
 * Crystal

### Lean software and Kanban
**Big Idea:** Reduce waste (waste is anything not delivered to the customer)

These are the principles of Lean Software Development
The most important principle is **eliminating waste** and examples follow.
Waste *products* are 
 * detailed requirements no one will read
 * partially done work
 * bloat features
 * bugs

Waste *processes* are
 * unnecessary tasks
 * task switching
 * waiting (dependency)
 * etc

**Amplify learning** is another principle to seek quality throughout. Instead of
"one take only" use "try-it, testit fix-it".

**Decide as late as possible** is a principle that promotes avoiding big upfront
design decisions/costs and try to make a decision when all necessary information
is available.

**Deliver as fast as possible**: Produce a working system every iteration, get
users to try it and benefit from feedback

**Empower the team** instead of having managers giving orders. Let the team take
the success of the project into their own hands.

**Build integrity in** is a principle that covers the need to maintain
consistency of a systems design.

**See the whole** is important in order to concentrating on the whole picture
instead of sweating the small stuff.

Lean software Development is a philosophy more than a all-knowing perfect
framework. Lots of successes in automobild manufacturing but on the other hand
there are limits since software has design and not production. The motion
analogy is morde difficult to translate to software development since moving to
see other people doesn't generate the same complexity as moving parts between
factories.

The Kanban approach is tightly linked with Lean (Toyta production) but focuses
on minimizing *work-in-progress* by ensuring just-in-time production (pull
system).

### Extreme programming
**Big idea:** Increment then simplify.
Add functionality (with tests), when it works look for reduced simplicity and
apply refactoring to it. Cycle it. Extreme in the sense of taking common-sense
principles and practices to the extreme.
