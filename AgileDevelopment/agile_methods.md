## Agile Methods
Descriptions of different agile methods/methodologies.
 * Lean software and Kanban
 * Extreme programming (XP)
 * Scrum
 * Crystal

### Lean software and Kanban
**Big Idea:** Reduce waste (waste is anything not delivered to the customer)

These are the principles of Lean Software Development
The most important principle is **eliminating waste** and examples follow.
Waste *products* are 
 * detailed requirements no one will read
 * partially done work
 * bloat features
 * bugs

Waste *processes* are
 * unnecessary tasks
 * task switching
 * waiting (dependency)
 * etc

**Amplify learning** is another principle to seek quality throughout. Instead of
"one take only" use "try-it, testit fix-it".

**Decide as late as possible** is a principle that promotes avoiding big upfront
design decisions/costs and try to make a decision when all necessary information
is available.

**Deliver as fast as possible**: Produce a working system every iteration, get
users to try it and benefit from feedback

**Empower the team** instead of having managers giving orders. Let the team take
the success of the project into their own hands.

**Build integrity in** is a principle that covers the need to maintain
consistency of a systems design.

**See the whole** is important in order to concentrating on the whole picture
instead of sweating the small stuff.

Lean software Development is a philosophy more than a all-knowing perfect
framework. Lots of successes in automobild manufacturing but on the other hand
there are limits since software has design and not production. The motion
analogy is morde difficult to translate to software development since moving to
see other people doesn't generate the same complexity as moving parts between
factories.

The Kanban approach is tightly linked with Lean (Toyta production) but focuses
on minimizing *work-in-progress* by ensuring just-in-time production (pull
system).

### Extreme programming
**Big idea:** Increment then simplify.

Add functionality (with tests), when it works look for reduced simplicity and
apply refactoring to it. Cycle it. Extreme in the sense of taking common-sense
principles and practices to the extreme.

Key **techniques** in XP
 * Short iterations
 * Pair Programming
 * User stories
 * Refactoring
 * Open Workspace
 * Collective code ownerships
 * Continous integration
 * Test-first (TDD)

Strenghs of XP is the consistency and strong oppinon in how programming should
be practiced

### Scrum
**Big Idea:** Freeze requirements during short iterations.

How should we handle change? Accept changes without letting them disrupt the
current iteration.

Key practices include
 * Sprint planning in the beginning
 * Closed-window rule, requirements can changed in a controlled way
 * User stories decomposed in tasks
 * Daily Scrum to track progres and isolate impediments
 * Definition of DOne
 * Task board and burndown charts to assess velocity
 * Sprint review

### Crystal
**Big idea:** Osmotic communication 

Q and As flow naturally and with little disturbance within the team.

Crystals 7 principles are:

**Frequent delivery** as in all agile methods

**Reflective improvement** in reflection workshop or iteration retrospective

**Osmotic communication** in order to avoid impediments and costs due to bad
communication within teams.

**Personal safety** in the sense that people should be able to speak up without
fear of reprisal.

**Focus** refers to developers working unimpedimented. This involves not being
asked to perform many tasks at once, handle side tasks not relevant to the
project goals, cope woth frequent interuptions etc

**Early access to expert users** is refering to customer involvement, but in
a more realistic way. Maybe one hour a week?

**Technical environment with automated tests, configuration management and
frequent integration** ...self explanatory


Crystal is morea concentrate of software development wisdom than step by step
guide. Whats unique about Crystal is it's avoidance of dogmatism.
